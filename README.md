# TO-DO-LIST-game-version-
Description:
This is a gamified To-Do application built with Python and Tkinter. The app motivates users to complete tasks by awarding XP (experience points) for completed tasks and penalizing for undone tasks. A Pomodoro timer is integrated to help users manage focus and breaks effectively. The interface includes intuitive colors, priority-based task visuals, and engaging feedback with sound effects.

Key Features:

✅ Add, complete, and mark tasks as undone

🎮 XP system to gamify task completion

⏱ Pomodoro timer with alerts for work and break periods

🎵 Sound effects for task completion, Pomodoro start, and breaks

🎨 Priority-based task colors for better visual organization

🌟 Gamified UI to make productivity fun and engaging

Technologies Used:

Python, Tkinter for GUI

Pygame for audio

PIL (Pillow) for images

MessageBox for alerts

Note: This project demonstrates my skills in Python GUI development, gamification concepts, and user experience design.
